# Azure CLI

To get started we need to setup a few resources in Azure. For this we are going to use the Azure CLI. If you donâ€™t have the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?WT.mc_id=aiapril-blog-heboelma&view=gaic-github-latest) installed on your machine you can follow the [tutorial on MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=aiml-36264-heboelma&view=azure-cli-latest) here.

* Install on [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli&WT.mc_id=aiml-34189-heboelma)
* Install on [macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos?WT.mc_id=aiml-36264-heboelma)

> All demos and content have been tested on a Windows PC, however all options should run from macOS and Linux machines as well. Please provide information via an issue or pull request if you have feedback on other operating systems.
